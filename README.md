# House Price Prediction - Kaggle Competition

## Overview
This project is an in-depth analysis and machine learning modeling exercise for the Kaggle competition "House Price Prediction." The goal is to predict residential home prices in Ames, Iowa, using various explanatory variables.

## Features of the Notebook
- **Data Exploration:** Analysis of the distribution of data, identification of missing values, and understanding relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data scaling/transformation.
- **Model Selection:** Evaluation of multiple machine learning models to identify the most effective ones.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimization of the chosen models for improved performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Use of cross-validation and other techniques to assess model performance.
- **Prediction and Submission:** Generating predictions for the test dataset and preparing a submission for the Kaggle competition.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Wrangling and Exploration:** Pandas, NumPy, Scipy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost

## Dataset
The dataset comprises 79 explanatory variables detailing various aspects of residential homes. More details can be found in the [dataset description](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Objectives
- Perform a thorough exploratory data analysis.
- Prepare the data for machine learning modeling.
- Build and tune ensemble model to predict house prices accurately.
- Assess model performance with suitable metrics.
- Create a final prediction for competition submission.
